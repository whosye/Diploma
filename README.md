1).
In repo, there are separet files with Simulink models and Matlab files. In order to run the optimization they need to be in the same folder. 
There are 3 optimization cycles for each object, such as sphere, cube and cone. Running files are named ga_Koule, ga_Kuzel and ga_Krychle.
For optimization was choosen the genetic algorithm matlab toolbox. 
2).
With special glove, that was made for this project, you can actuate the Simulink model named "All" and attached Arduino file.
